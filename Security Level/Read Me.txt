**************Macro Security Level For MS Office**************

From 2 years, I made some macros in PowerPoint, and I want my 
project to be puplic and easy to use, but there was a problem
I faced, it was the secuirity level which I want it to be low
to make my project work smoothly, sppecially if we know that 
Norton antivirus make secuirity to high, so user can't feel
if there was any macro.
So I use this program attached, and put it in the startup of
the CD, so it work directly when put the CD to adjust security
level to low.  
You can check its work from Word or powerpoint select tool 
menu then macro, finally security to check the level, then
close the program (Don't forget that) and run our program
and test it like above.
Note that: I test the program for Office2000 & OfficeXP
